# First_Person_Shooter_WebGL
This project is a first person shooting gallery made in WebGL for my computer graphics course at University of the Pacific.
This was a group project with Dean Shin, Christopher Ciobanu, and myself. I worked on sprites, models and textures for this game, as well as general debugging.

The game uses a mouse cursor for aim, wasd/arrowkeys for movement, and spacebar for firing the gun.
